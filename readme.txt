My first program that use streams. Now there are many things i would do better but then
i have learned a lot about app structure, streams, validators and separating view and controler
from business logic



GUI:

Gui works fully

few exercises from recrutation for java developers. I have learned how to redirect
input stream from console to file



OOP:

are no content, just simple demo of the idea. It helped me better structure 
the code.

make something bigger than Person + Main :)

florist - small project that i give my students when i learn them how to use inheritance

football - football game simulation. If player has'nt got ball i set it's refference
to null. some time later I learned that it was a bad way of handling absent refferences.

You can play standard 1v1 game of battleships in console. Also before start
you have to set localisation of all ships.
